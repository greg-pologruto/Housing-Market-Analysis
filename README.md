# Housing Market Analysis
This is a data analytics project that was assigned to me in my data management and manipulation class. I was tasked with finding a dataset and conducting a statistical study on it.

This project was made using R. I utilized the xaringan package to create a slideshow presentation.

If you want to view the presentation I recommend downloading the source code (rmd file) and knitting it yourself in RStudio. The raw HTML file does not display properly.
